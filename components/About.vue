                <p class="mb-4">Welcome to my corner of the digital realm! I'm Dhiraj Raut, a driven Software Quality
                    Assurance Engineer with a passion for perfecting the user experience. With over 18 months of
                    hands-on experience in the field, I've honed my skills across various testing methodologies,
                    including manual, API, and automation testing.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                    My journey in software quality assurance began with a commitment to ensuring the reliability and
                    robustness of every digital product I touch. Whether meticulously combing through code to identify
                    potential issues, conducting comprehensive API tests to validate functionality, or harnessing the
                    power of automation to streamline testing processes, I thrive on the challenge of delivering
                    software solutions of the highest caliber.

                    <p>
                    Join me on this journey as we embark on a quest to elevate the standard of quality in the digital
                    landscape, one meticulously tested line of code at a time.
